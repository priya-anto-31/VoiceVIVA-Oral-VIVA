Introducing our oral viva service powered by Gemini, where we provide
random questions on a particular topic of your choice. Here's how it
works:

1. You specify the topic you'd like to be questioned on.
2. Our system generates random questions related to the topic using
Gemini's capabilities.
3. We present these questions to you in text format, along with a time
limit for each question.
4. You respond to each question by recording your answer as audio.
5. Your audio responses are then converted into text using Python's
speech-to-text functionality.
6. The system evaluates the correctness of your answers using Gemini's
natural language processing capabilities.
7. Feedback on the correctness of each answer is provided, along with
a score based on the accuracy of your responses.
8. You're then given the option to continue answering more questions
or to end the session.

This interactive viva service offers a dynamic and engaging way to
test your knowledge on a given topic. By combining Gemini's question
generation and evaluation capabilities with Python's speech-to-text
functionality, we ensure a seamless and efficient experience for our
users. Whether you're looking to practice or assess your
understanding, our oral viva service has you covered.
