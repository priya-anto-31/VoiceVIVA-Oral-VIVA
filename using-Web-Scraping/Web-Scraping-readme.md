Introducing our oral viva service, where we leverage the power of web
scraping to ask relevant questions based on the link you provide.
Here's how it works:

1. You provide us with the link to the website or webpage you want us
to extract information from.
2. Our web scraping algorithm retrieves the necessary data and
generates questions based on the content.
3. We present these questions to you orally, one by one, allowing you
to respond verbally.
4. Your answers are then recorded in audio format.
5. Finally, we display the transcribed answers without assigning any
points, allowing you to focus on the content rather than worrying
about scoring.

This service offers a convenient and efficient way to assess your
knowledge and understanding of the provided material. With our
seamless integration of web scraping and oral questioning, you can
expect a comprehensive evaluation tailored to your specific needs.
